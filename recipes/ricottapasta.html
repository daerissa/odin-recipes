                    little neutral oil until the onion is shiny and soft, but without 
                    taking on color. </li>
                <li>Clean the spinach and remove thick stems and ugly leaves. 
                    Rinse well and shake off most of the water. Roughly chop 
                    the spinach and put it in the pot together with the onion.If necessary, add a 
                    little more oil and let the spinach simmer while stirring, until it just collapses.</li>  
                <li>tir together the ricotta and some of the pasta water (milk / cream), 
                    and stir it together with the vegetables.</li>  
                <li>Season with grated nutmeg, salt and pepper. Add the tomatoes and 
                    let the sauce simmer for a few minutes, until the tomatoes are
